# ⚡ flow

**A structured, portable dev-workflow skill suite.**
Take one tracked issue from *ticket → merged-and-verified* — and bootstrap whole projects from a PRD — with the same discipline on any agent harness.

## What it is

`flow` is a suite of **16 skills** that encode a full delivery workflow — generalized from a
battle-tested Claude Code slash-command setup so the *discipline* travels to any project or harness.
It's structured on purpose: hard gates, evidence-backed acceptance criteria, and an audit trail,
not vibes.

> **Status — honest:** the suite is written and internally consistent but **not yet run end-to-end**.
> Treat your first real project as the validation pass (see [`VALIDATION.md`](VALIDATION.md)).

## The core idea: spine + profile

| | |
|---|---|
| **Spine** (this package) | The invariant discipline — phase order, hard gates, AC classification with evidence receipts, the audit-comment contract, WIP-attempt recovery, same-SHA flap detection. *Never changes between projects.* |
| **Profile** (`workflow-profile.yaml`, per project) | Every substitutable noun — tracker + issue-id format, branch/commit/PR conventions, lint/format/type/test commands, deploy-identity & health checks, doc paths, architecture rules. |

The spine reads the profile and runs. A Python/Hetzner project and a Node/Vercel project fill in
different commands — the same pipeline runs unchanged.

## The skills

**Delivery**
| Skill | Does |
|---|---|
| `flow-ship-issue` | The flagship pipeline: pick → implement → sanity → review → ship *(the old `/go`)* |
| `flow-fix` | Recover a broken ship run — diagnose the failed phase **from git state**, fix, resume |

**Inception** — bootstrap a project from a PRD
| Skill | Does |
|---|---|
| `flow-init` | Scaffold docs skeleton + `workflow-profile.yaml` (greenfield or gap-fill; PRD-aware) |
| `flow-plan-project` | PRD → phases → create Linear **project + milestones + issues** + seed the plan |
| `flow-gen-claudemd` | Generate `CLAUDE.md` in the house style |

**Cadence**
| Skill | Does |
|---|---|
| `flow-cycle-start` / `flow-cycle-end` | Weekly rituals — active cycle, rollover, velocity, status update |
| `flow-retro` | Milestone retro: **invariant → guard audit** + lessons-to-memory |

**Scope & docs**
| Skill | Does |
|---|---|
| `flow-change-scope` | Formalize add/drop/modify across spec + plan + overview + tracker + ADR |
| `flow-sync-plan` | Reconcile the plan doc with the tracker (mechanical gap sweep) |

**Session & status**
| Skill | Does |
|---|---|
| `flow-session-check` | Restore context: branch → issue → git state → directional AC |
| `flow-status` | Fast local-only git snapshot (no network) |
| `flow-sync-issue-status` | Reconcile a drifted tracker status from git/PR state |

**Ops & meta**
| Skill | Does |
|---|---|
| `flow-server-audit` | Prod durability/security/drift audit (deploy-topology template) |
| `flow-doctor` | Preflight — is the profile complete and do its commands/paths/tracker resolve? |
| `flow` | Index/help — *"what can this do?"*, routes you to the right skill |

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install as a Claude Code plugin (keeps the package intact — see install/claude-code.md)
/plugin marketplace add noahwins-ng/flow-workflow
/plugin install flow@flow
```

**Existing project:** `flow-init` → `flow-doctor` → work with `flow-ship-issue <ID>`.

**New project from a PRD:** drop your brief in the repo, then
`flow-init` → `flow-doctor` → `flow-plan-project` → `flow-gen-claudemd` → `flow-cycle-start`.

Full walkthrough in [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md).

## Harness support

Distributed as a **multi-manifest plugin** (one `skills/` source + a thin manifest per harness), the
pattern used by [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). This keeps the package a
**unit per harness**, so shared `adapters/`, `method/`, and cross-skill references resolve.

| Harness | Status |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ supported (`.claude-plugin/` present) |
| Cursor · Codex · opencode · pi | 🚧 aspirational — manifest per harness, added after Claude Code is validated |

Portability is designed in: tracker access is **native-MCP-first with a `curl`+`jq` fallback**,
deploy/verify goes through profile shell commands, phases load by plain file reads (progressive
disclosure), and the fresh-eyes reviewer is optional. Details: [`install/`](install/).
