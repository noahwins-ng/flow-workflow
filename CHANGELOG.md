# Changelog

All notable changes to the `flow` dev-workflow skill suite. Format loosely follows Keep a Changelog.
The **spine** ships from this repo; each adopting project keeps its own `workflow-profile.yaml`, so
"updating" a project = pulling a new spine version here (the profile schema is backward-additive).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-03
### Added
- Initial suite, generalized from a Claude-Code slash-command workflow. 11 skills, all namespaced
  `flow-`: ship-issue (the old `/go` pipeline), session-check, sync-issue-status, status,
  cycle-start, cycle-end, sync-plan, change-scope, retro, server-audit, init.
- `flow-doctor` preflight (profile + environment health check).
- Spine + profile design: invariant discipline in the skills, project nouns in `profile.template.yaml`.
- Tracker as a capability: native Linear MCP first, `adapters/linear.sh` (curl+jq) fallback —
  get/status/comment plus cadence ops (active cycle, project status update).
- Shipped methodology: `method/conventions.md` + `method/docs-skeleton/` scaffolded by `flow-init`.
- Claude Code install layer under `install/`.

### Known gaps
- Not yet run end-to-end (validation deferred to a real Claude Code project).
- `adapters/linear.sh` not smoke-tested against the live API.
- Only Claude Code install is documented; Codex / Cursor / opencode / pi are aspirational targets.
